# Web-/PHPStorm Live templates for reveal.js

This repository includes my live templates for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to be able to create a revealjs based presentation faster and more intuitive (at least for me).

If you want to use these templates, copy `Reveal.xml` to:

Windows: `<your home directory>\.<product name><version number>\config\templates`  

Linux: `~\.<product name><version number>\config\templates`   

MacOS: `~/Library/Preferences/<product name><version number>/templates`  

-----

Currently available shortcuts:

`revealstart` Start a new presentation (e.g. index.html)  
`sltitle` a Title slide  
`slnote` a slide with a speaker note (aside)  
`sllist` a slide with a unordered list  
`slimage` a slide with an image  
`slquote` a slide with a block quote  
`slfragmented` a slide with fragemnted view (examples)  
`slcode` a slide with a code snippit and highlighting, contenteditable.  
`slidenoteonly` just the `<aside>` for a slide note for speakers view
